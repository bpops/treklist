TrekList is an application that expands on what I had already made: a Star Trek episode tracker written in Excel. But this is a standalone, automated, self-updating version with added features and capabilities. I am writing this for ME. But you can use it, too. LLAP :vulcan_salute:

## Development

You will need to [generate an OMDb API key](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Place the key in a text file called `api_key` in the repo's base directory. 

To build the database, execute the `build_db.ipynb' notebook.
