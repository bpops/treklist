TrekList is an application to maintain an offline record of your Star Trek viewing experience. It is written in Python, uses SQLlite for its database, and ODMB to populate new episodes.

## Setup

You will need to [generate an API key](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Place the key in a text file called `api_key` in the repo's directory. 

TrekList is in no way affiliated with Star Trek or Paramount Global.
